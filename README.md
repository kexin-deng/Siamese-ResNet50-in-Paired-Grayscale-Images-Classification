# Siamese-ResNet50-in-Paired-Grayscale-Images-Classification
Designed a Siamese ResNet50 in PyTorch to classify paired grayscale images for a rock–paper–scissors Kaggle challenge. Used shared encoders with feature concatenation and FC layers. Tuned warm restarts, dropout, balanced BCE, mixed precision, and F1-based thresholds. Achieved 0.9048 private LB accuracy, outperforming multiple baselines.
